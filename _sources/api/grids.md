Grids
=====

In order to solve a problem using the boundary element method, we must first define the grid
(or mesh) on which the problem will be discretised.
In Bempp, the grid will be a triangulation of a 2D surface in 3D space.
Bempp currently only supports grids consisting of flat surface triangles.

This section looks at how grids can be created and used in Bempp.
