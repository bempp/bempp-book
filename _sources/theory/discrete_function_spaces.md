Discrete Function Spaces
========================

When approximating the solution of a problem with the boundary element method, finite-dimensional
subspaces of the relevant [Sobolev spaces](sobolev_spaces.md) are used to discretise the problem.

In this section of the Bempp Handbook, we look at how these discrete spaces are defined.
